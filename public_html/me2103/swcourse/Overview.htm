<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name='11'></a>1.1 Introduction<br>
  <br>
  </b>The 3D Solid Modeling on SolidWorks is a Windows native 3D Mechanical design 
  automation software. Being Windows native, the software bears the familiar Microsoft&reg; 
  Windows&reg; graphical user interface. SolidWorks 3D Solid Modeling allows for 
  feature-based part modeling capabilities and it could create designs easily 
  using extrusion, revolution, advanced shelling, feature patterns and holes etc. 
  Besides part modeling, the software allows users to create assemblies where 
  design to the components could easily be changed from within the assembly. SolidWorks 
  also has the capability to generate complete, production-ready engineering drawings 
  effortlessly. The fully associative drawings allow drawing views to update automatically 
  each time the part or assembly design is modified. In this "Introduction to 
  3D Solid Modeling (SolidWorks)" topic, eDrawings, a new type of electronic file, 
  will also be briefly discussed together with part modeling, assembly modeling 
  and drawing in SolidWorks. <br>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name='12'></a>1.2 Objectives<br>
  <br>
  </b>The objective of this topic on "Introduction to 3D Solid Modeling (SolidWorks)" 
  is to allow beginners or users who do not have any engineering drawing background 
  to have a head start in 3D Solid Modeling using SolidWorks without assistance 
  from trainers, through e-Learning. This topic covers the basic functionalities 
  that are being used in SolidWorks. It is designed to be broad-based and covers 
  part modeling, assembly modeling, drawing and eDrawings. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name='13'></a>1.3 Applications<br>
  <br>
  </b>SolidWorks 3D Solid Modeling is used in a wide variety of mechanical designs 
  on the industry level, such as design of medical equipments, automation lines, 
  machining centers, moulds and dies, machinery products, consumer products and 
  electronic products etc. On the educational level, SolidWorks enables students 
  in their lower years of their undergraduate course to create and visualize 3D 
  models easily during their engineering drawing classes. Students could also 
  use SolidWorks to create complex models necessary for their projects in their 
  higher level of their education. </font></p>

  <br>
  </b>This topic on "Introduction to 3D Solid Modeling (SolidWorks)" assumes that 
  users are familiar with Windows environment, such as how to run programs, resize 
  Windows, saving a file in Windows etc. Users should also have a basic understanding 
  of geometry, simple mathematics and mathematical relationships. </font></p>
